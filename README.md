# CFD-with-Matlab

12 small steps to efficiently solve Navier-Stokes equations with Matlab

Here we want to establish a basic knowledge for writing a code that performs CFD analysis using Matlab.

By PhD candidate **Hojjat Naderi** from Sharif University of Technology, Mechanical Engineering Departemnt.

The inital work that this code is based on is done by **Prof. Lorena A. Barba** and her team. I'd like to thank them for their great educational contribution to CFD. Their code is written in Python language. Converting their code and algorithm to Matlab language requires some effort which might prove difficult for learners with basic CFD coding experience. Since Matlab is popular among engineering students, writing their code in Matlab might be useful for some.

There is another repository on GitHub that does the same thing. But they use "interloops" instead of "array operations" and for that reason there code takes longer run times and is not efficient. Our code stays true to the source algorithm and discards any unnecessary parameters and loops.
